<pre>
        Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things
        that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines.
        Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.
    </pre>
<b>Welcome!</b> You can find all the necessary information about our school on this page
<h2 id="About us">About us</h2>
<h3>What do the lessons look like?</h3>
<p>Classes at the school are based on the already classical communicative methodology, where new material (vocabulary,
    grammar) <br>
    is practiced in a <em>playful or conversational form</em> in small mini-groups or pairs. Based on the results of
    each course, <br>
    you can count on successfully passing a language exam of the appropriate level in all four skills - reading,
    writing, <br>
    speaking and listening. </p>
<p>We try to use all the new and cool applications that all our teachers found quite effective — <a
        href="https://miro.com/ru/" rel="external">Miro</a>, <abbr title="Google Class">GC</abbr>, etc. </p>
<h3>How many people are in the group?</h3>
<i>On average</i>, from 5 to 8 people.
<h2>School rules</h2>
<blockquote>Look, that's why there's rules, understand?<br>
    So that you think before you break 'em.
</blockquote>
― Terry Pratchett, <cite>Thief of Time</cite>
<p>Just as physics and chemistry have their own rules (like <em>Na+Cl<sub>2</sub>->NaCl</em> or
    <em>E=mc<sup>2</sup></em>), they also exist in our school.</p>
<p>The most important rule - <strong>respect other people's borders</strong>.</p>

            <li>It is best to use the portfolio system — and systematically put all the printouts in a special folder
