        Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things
        that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines.

        <h3>What do the lessons look like?</h3>
        <p>Classes at the school are based on the already classical communicative methodology, where new material
            (vocabulary, grammar) <br>
            is practiced in a <em>playful or conversational form</em> in small mini-groups or pairs. Based on the
            results of each course, <br>
            you can count on successfully passing a language exam of the appropriate level in all four skills - reading,
            writing, <br>
            speaking and listening. </p>
        <p>We try to use all the new and cool applications that all our teachers found quite effective — <a
                href="https://miro.com/ru/" rel="external">Miro</a>, <abbr title="Google Class">GC</abbr>, etc. </p>
        <h3>How many people are in the group?</h3>
        <p><i>On average</i>, from 5 to 8 people.</p>

        <p>Just as physics and chemistry have their own rules (like <em>Na+Cl<sub>2</sub>->NaCl</em> or
            <em>E=mc<sup>2</sup></em>), they also exist in our school.</p>
        <p>The most important rule - <strong>respect other people's borders</strong>.</p>

                        results
