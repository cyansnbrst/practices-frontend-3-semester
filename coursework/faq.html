                            qualified and experienced British Council English teaching professionals can guide you. Our
                            teachers are experienced in working with students from many different countries and are
                            online teaching specialists</p>

                        <h3>How can I improve my speaking and pronunciation?</h3>
                        <p>On LLS you can watch our series of videos in our speaking skills section to practise
                            your speaking skills. You can improve your speaking by noticing the language we use in
                            different situations and practising useful phrases</p>
                        <p>However, to really put your speaking into practice you need to speak to other learners and
                            ideally to a teacher who can correct your mistakes and advise you on how to improve your
                            speaking and pronunciation. Our live online classes offer exposure to different accents
                            which is essential in a world where language is spoken by millions of people from different
                            countries. We think this is the best way for our students to be better prepared to deal with
                            real-life situations</p>

                            writing by understanding model texts and how they're structured. Join our online community
                            and write comments and respond to other learners to put your knowledge into practice.
