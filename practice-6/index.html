        Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things
        that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines.
        Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.

        <h3>What do the lessons look like?</h3>
        <p>Classes at the school are based on the already classical communicative methodology, where new material
            (vocabulary, grammar) <br>
            is practiced in a <em>playful or conversational form</em> in small mini-groups or pairs. Based on the
            results of each course, <br>
            you can count on successfully passing a language exam of the appropriate level in all four skills - reading,
            writing, <br>
            speaking and listening. </p>
        <p>We try to use all the new and cool applications that all our teachers found quite effective — <a
                href="https://miro.com/ru/" rel="external">Miro</a>, <abbr title="Google Class">GC</abbr>, etc. </p>
        <h3>How many people are in the group?</h3>
        <p><i>On average</i>, from 5 to 8 people.</p>

            <blockquote>Look, that's why there's rules, understand?<br>
                So that you think before you break 'em.

        <p>Just as physics and chemistry have their own rules (like <em>Na+Cl<sub>2</sub>->NaCl</em> or
            <em>E=mc<sup>2</sup></em>), they also exist in our school.</p>
        <p>The most important rule - <strong>respect other people's borders</strong>.</p>
